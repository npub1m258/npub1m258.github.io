### npub1m258
I am a medical student and junior agent with CVANR. I was invited to join the project recently and was selected to be the first to set up channels of anonymous communication with the world.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CVANR 
## Purpose 
We are an anonymous, decentralized, nonprofessional research collective investigating _Neurodrome_ phenomena. 

## Ethos
Our work is rooted in curiosity and objectivity. 

## Objectives
We have no motives other than to discover, organize, interpret and deliver information about this emerging trend of activity. We utilize our own bespoke technologies to capture the subjective, interior experiences of individuals who have participated with and affected by the _Neurodrome_.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_We are ever grateful for the bravery and openness of Participants in sharing their experiences with CVANR._
